Participants with a mix of senior and junior researchers hailing from both
academia and industry encouraged fruitful dialogue. A number of future
research agendas were recognized. Brian Trammell volunteered to initiate
further discussion on the seminar mailing list towards measurement platform
integration. An action item to create a code repository to hold basic
primitives that can output results in a machine readable manner was created.
Furthermore, discussion on an Internet measurement cloud for not only storing
measurement results but also facilitate its reliable distribution will begin.
The organizing team also received valuable feedback. An interest to identify a
specific problem to try to tackle it during a prospective future seminar was
identified.
